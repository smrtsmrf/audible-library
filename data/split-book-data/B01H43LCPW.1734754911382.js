If he played by the rules, they said, he could enjoy everyone else’s version of middle class success. But when he tried it their way, he hit rock bottom. </p> <p>Then he tried the opposite approach. He said NO to the haters and naysayers and said YES to his burning, outrageous, animal obsession.

And it can help you achieve massive success too. As Grant says, we're in the middle of an epidemic of average. The conventional wisdom is to achieve balance and take it easy. But this has really just given us an excuse to be unexceptional. </p> <p>If you want real success, you have to be obsessed and know how to harness that power to rocket to the top. This book will give you the inspiration and tools to break out of your cocoon of mediocrity and achieve your craziest dreams. Grant will teach you how to: </p> <p>· set crazy goals—and reach them, every single day<br>· feed the beast: when you value money and spend it on the right things, you get more of it<br>· shut down the doubters—and use your haters as fuel</p> <p>You can be obsessed...or you can be average. It’s your choice. Why not start going full-throttle towards your obsession today?</p>";
