window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A radically new cosmological view from a groundbreaking neuroscientist placing the human brain at the center of humanity’s universe </b></p> <p>Renowned neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis introduces listeners to a revolutionary new theory of how the human brain evolved to become an organic computer without rival in the known universe. </p> <p>Nicolelis undertakes the first attempt to explain the entirety of human history, culture, and civilization based on a series of recently uncovered key principles of brain function. This new cosmology is centered around three fundamental properties of the human brain: its insurmountable malleability to adapt and learn; its exquisite ability to allow multiple individuals to synchronize their minds around a task, goal, or belief; and its incomparable capacity for abstraction. </p> <p>Combining insights from such diverse fields as neuroscience, mathematics, evolution, computer science, physics, history, art, and philosophy, Nicolelis presents a neurobiologically based manifesto for the uniqueness of the human mind and a cautionary tale of the threats that technology poses to present and future generations.</p>";
