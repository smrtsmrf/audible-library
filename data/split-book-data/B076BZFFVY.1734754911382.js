window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We had been in India about two years, doing regular routine research work, when I met the Master known in these writings as Emil. While walking along a street in the city where we were staying, my attention was attracted to a crowd. I saw the center of interest was one of the street magicians, or fakirs, that are so common in that country. </p> <p>As I stood there I noticed beside me an elderly man who was not of the same caste as those about him. He looked at me and asked if I had been long in India. </p> <p>I replied, \"About two years.\" </p> <p>He asked, \"Are you English?\" </p> <p>I answered. \"American.\" </p>";
