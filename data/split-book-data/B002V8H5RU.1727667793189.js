window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Intention is generally viewed as a pit bull kind of determination propelling one to succeed at all costs by never giving up on an inner picture. In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this audiobook. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has researched intention as a force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. This audiobook explores intention, not as something you do, but as an energy you're a part of. We're all intended here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first audiobook to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention. </p>";
