window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Discover how to tap in to your extraordinary human capacity for connection and healing using astonishing new findings about the miraculous power of group intention and its boomerang effect in this new book by the author of the international best sellers <i>The Intention Experiment</i> and <i>The Field</i>. </p> <p>What we send out into the universe comes back to us magnified. Although the power of intention - the energy of positive thoughts - is widely accepted as an influential force in transforming lives, the exponential power of group intention has never been explored - until now. </p> <p>In <i>The Power of Eight</i>, Lynne McTaggart, an expert on the science of spirituality, reveals her remarkable findings from 10 years of experiments about how group intention can heal our lives - and change the world for the better. When individuals in a group focus their intention together on a single target, a powerful collective dynamic emerges that can heal longstanding conditions, mend fractured relationships, lower violence, and even rekindle life purpose. But the greatest untold truth of all is that group intention has a mirror effect, not only affecting the recipient but also reflecting back on the senders. </p> <p>Drawing on hundreds of case studies, the latest brain research, and dozens of McTaggart's own university studies, <i>The Power of Eight</i> provides solid evidence showing that there is such a thing as a collective consciousness. Now you can learn to use it and unleash the power you hold inside of you to heal your own life, with help from this riveting, highly accessible new book. </p>";
