One truth is the difference between understanding everything or knowing nothing. It’s the difference between being whole or feeling lost.</p> <p>If you have the courage to set aside what you think you know, this book has the answers you’ve never quite been able to grasp. If you have the courage to read with a truly open mind, you won’t ever have to search for the truth again.</p> <p>Erin Werley used to feel lost, as if the big questions were unanswerable. Then, one day, she started to receive deposits from her inner voice, which calls itself “I Am.” And everything in her life began to change.</p> <p>I Am’s intention with this book is not to offer you information that can only come through Werley. It’s to teach you how to access your own inner voice so you’ll be able to make your dreams a reality.</p> <p>Whether you’re a new seeker or you’ve already awakened, <i>One Truth, One Law</i> is the last book on spirituality you’ll ever feel the need to listen to.</p>";
