window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Physics of the Impossible, Physics of the Future</i> and <i>Hyperspace</i> tackles the most fascinating and complex object in the known universe: the human brain.</b> </p> <p>For the first time in history, the secrets of the living brain are being revealed by a battery of high-tech brain scans devised by physicists. Now what was once solely the province of science fiction has become a startling reality. Recording memories, telepathy, videotaping our dreams, mind control, avatars, and telekinesis are not only possible; they already exist. </p> <p><i>The Future of the Mind</i> gives us an authoritative and compelling look at the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the world - all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics. One day we might have a \"smart pill\" that can enhance our cognition; be able to upload our brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; send thoughts and emotions around the world on a \"brain-net\"; control computers and robots with our mind; push the very limits of immortality; and perhaps even send our consciousness across the universe. </p> <p>Dr. Kaku takes us on a grand tour of what the future might hold, giving us not only a solid sense of how the brain functions but also how these technologies will change our daily lives. He even presents a radically new way to think about \"consciousness\" and applies it to provide fresh insight into mental illness, artificial intelligence and alien consciousness. </p> <p>With Dr. Kaku's deep understanding of modern science and keen eye for future developments, <i>The Future of the Mind</i> is a scientific tour de force - an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience.</p>";
