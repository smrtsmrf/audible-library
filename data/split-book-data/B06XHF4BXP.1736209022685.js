window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>We're in trouble. But there is help ... if we listen.</b> </p> <p>In the middle of the night on August 2, 2016, Neale Donald Walsch found himself drawn into a new and totally unexpected dialogue with God in which he suddenly faced two questions: Is the human race being offered help by Highly Evolved Beings from Another Dimension? Is there a key role that humans are being invited to play in advancing their own evolution by joining in a mutual mission to assist the planet during the critical times ahead? </p> <p>He was told that the answer to both questions is yes. </p> <p>Then he was given 16 specific examples of how Highly Evolved Beings respond to life differently than humans do - and how adopting even a few of those behaviors could change the course of world history for the better forever. </p> <p>That information makes up the body of this work. </p> <p>A striking invitation to every listener sets the stage for the extraordinary explorations that follow. Picking up where Book 3 in the Conversations with God Trilogy series left off, the revelations about Highly Evolved Beings and about how ordinary humans can answer the call to help awaken the species on Earth will breathtakingly expand your view of both your personal and your collective future. </p> <p>Which is exactly what the dialogue was intended to do. </p>";
