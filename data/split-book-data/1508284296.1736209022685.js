While meditating, she spontaneously accessed an energy field - a level of consciousness - previously unbeknownst to her. This dramatic awakening changed her life, freeing her from years of struggle and pain.</p> <p>It also set Dr. Morter on her new lifeâ€™s mission to deepen her studies of energy healing and medicine in the hopes of recreating this radical, positive transformation for herself and her patients. Through years of study, she developed the seven energy codes, a life-changing program that has enabled herself and her patients to overcome pain, disease, fatigue, anxiety, and depression and to awaken creativity. </p> <p>Inspired by the seven chakras and bridging ancient healing practices with cutting-edge science, <i>The Energy Codes</i> offers a detailed road map to help you activate previously untapped energy and neurocircuitry within the body. Grounded in practical, accessible exercises like simple yoga sequences, breathwork, and meditations, and complete with dozens of inspiring success stories, <i>The Energy Codes</i> empowers you to tap into your hidden potential and become one with your true, essential self: the pure energy of your being. Prepare to change your life by changing your energy. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
