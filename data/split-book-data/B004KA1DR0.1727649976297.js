window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>V. S. Ramachandran is at the forefront of his field - so much so that Richard Dawkins dubbed him the \"Marco Polo of neuroscience\". Now, in a major new work, Ramachandran sets his sights on the mystery of human uniqueness. </p> <p>Taking us to the frontiers of neurology, he reveals what baffling and extreme case studies can teach us about normal brain function and how it evolved. Synesthesia becomes a window into the brain mechanisms that make some of us more creative than others. And autism - for which Ramachandran opens a new direction for treatment - gives us a glimpse of the aspect of being human that we understand least: self-awareness. </p> <p>Ramachandran tackles the most exciting and controversial topics in neurology with a storyteller's eye for compelling case studies and a researcher's flair for new approaches to age-old questions. Tracing the strange links between neurology and behavior, this book unveils a wealth of clues into the deepest mysteries of the human brain. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</p>";
