window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“An insightful memoir that uncovers unique stories about matters of the heart.” (</b><b><i>Essence</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>The inspiring <i>New York Times</i> best seller from Common - the Grammy Award, Academy Award, and Golden Globe-winning musician, actor, and activist - explores how love and mindfulness can build communities and allow you to take better control of your life through actions and words. </p> <p>Common believes that the phrase “let love have the last word” is not just a declaration; it is a statement of purpose, a daily promise. Love is the most powerful force on the planet, and ultimately, the way you love determines who you are and how you experience life. </p> <p>Touching on God, self-love, partners, children, family, and community, Common explores the core tenets of love to help us understand what it means to receive and, most important, to give love. He moves from the personal - writing about his daughter, to whom he wants to be a better father - to the universal, where he observes that our society has become fractured under issues of race and politics. He knows there's no quick remedy for all of the hurt in the world, but love - for yourself and for others - is where the healing begins. </p> <p>In his first public reveal, Common also shares a deeply personal experience of childhood molestation that he is now confronting...and forgiving. </p> <p>Courageous, insightful, brave, and characteristically authentic, <i>Let Love Have the Last Word</i> shares Common’s own unique and personal stories of the people and experiences that have led to a greater understanding of love and all it has to offer. It is a powerful call to action for a new generation of open hearts and minds, one that is sure to resonate for years to come.</p>";
