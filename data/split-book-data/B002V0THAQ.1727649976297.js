window.bookSummaryJSON = "First there was a conversation. It developed into a friendship. And now we stand on the threshold of spiritual oneness...of Communion with God. Neale Donald Walsch, along with Edward Asner and Ellen Burstyn, reads the latest in the life-altering series that began with <i>Conversations with God</i>. <p>You have learned to talk to God, to have a conversation. You have been given strength, hope, and love in your friendship with God, and you have returned it, for faith is a two-way street. Now God reaches out again...offering you wholeness...communion. Now you will know the God who believes in you. You have come here to learn, through your own experience, that God resides within you. You have come to have a meeting with the Creator - a Creator who is within you and all around you. And in order to do so, you must look beyond the Ten Illusions of Humans. When you recognize these illusions, you can change the way you think. When you accept that they are only illusions, you can change what you believe. And when you live without them, you can change the world.</p>";
