window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Combining the best current medical knowledge with a new approach grounded in integrative medicine, Chopra and Tanzi offer a groundbreaking new model of healing and the healing system, one of the main mysteries in the mind-body connection.</b> </p> <p><i>The Healing Self</i> is a breakthrough audiobook in self-care for a wide audience. Immunity - the body's ability to ward off disease - can no longer be taken for granted. Current trends in the public health are disturbing. From increased jet travel, allowing newly mutated bacteria and viruses to have a worldwide reach, to MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that are outstripping new drugs to fight them, to an increase in deaths from hospital-acquired infections, to an aging population whose childhood vaccinations are losing their effectiveness, our well-being is at a dangerous crossroads. </p> <p>Yet Chopra and Tanzi see hope and offer new ways of increasing the body's immune system by stimulating the brain, our genes, helping to reduce inflammation in the body and increase our capacities to fight off illness and disease. In the brain, it has been long believed that only the innate immune system is at work. However, the recent exciting discovery that the brain possesses a lymphatic system means that it is also tied into adaptive immune system (antibodies, T- and B-cells, etc.). This knowledge can be used together with new facts about the gut microbiome to help reduce neuro-inflammation with changes in lifestyle, diet, and stress reduction.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
