If you are, Gary John Bishop has the answer. In this straightforward handbook, he gives you the tools and advice you need to demolish the slag weighing you down and become the truly unf*cked version of yourself. \"Wake up to the miracle you are,\" he directs. \"Here's what you've forgotten: You're a f*cking miracle of being.\" It isn't other people that are standing in your way; it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive. It's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself. </p> <p>In <i>Unf*ck Yourself</i>, Bishop leads you through a series of seven assertions: </p> <ul> <li>I am willing </li> <li>I am wired to win </li> <li>I got this </li> <li>I embrace the uncertainty </li> <li>I am not my thoughts; I am what I do </li> <li>I am relentless </li> <li>I expect nothing and accept everything </li> </ul> <p>Lead the life you were meant to have - <i>Unf*ck Yourself</i>. </p>";
