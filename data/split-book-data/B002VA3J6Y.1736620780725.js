window.bookSummaryJSON = "Suppose you could ask God the most puzzling questions about existence, and God would provide clear, understandable answers? It happened to Neale Donald Walsch. <p><i>Conversations with God</i> is Neale Donald Walsch's account of his direct conversations with God, beginning in 1992 while Walsch was immersed in a period of deep depression. He composed a letter to God in which he vented his frustrations, and much to his surprise, even shock, God answered him. </p> <p>Focusing on the universal truths that influence all life, <i>Conversations with God</i> offers a picture of the could be better. <i>Conversations with God</i> challenges us to push past the imagined boundaries of what we believe ourselves capable and look instead to all that we can attain as co-creators with God.</p>";
