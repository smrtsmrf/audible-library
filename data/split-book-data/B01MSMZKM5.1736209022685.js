window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The authors of the best-selling <i>Bold</i> and <i>The Rise of Superman</i> explore altered states of consciousness and how they can ignite passion, fuel creativity, and accelerate problem solving, in this groundbreaking book in the vein of Daniel Pink's <i>Drive</i> and Charles Duhigg's <i>Smarter Faster Better</i>. </p> <p>Why has generating \"flow\" and getting \"into the zone\" become the goal of the world's most elite organizations? Why are business moguls attending Burning Man? Why has meditation become a billion-dollar industry? Why are technology gurus turning to psychedelic drugs to unlock creativity? </p> <p>All of these people are seeking to shift their state of mind as a way of unlocking their true potential. Altered states, the authors reveal, sharpen our decision-making capabilities, unleash creativity, fuel cooperation, and let us tap in to levels of inspiration and innovation unavailable at all other times. <i>Stealing Fire</i> combines cutting-edge research and firsthand reporting to explore a revolution in human performance - a movement millions of people strong to harness and utilize some of the most misunderstood and controversial experiences in history. </p> <p>Building a bridge between the extreme and the mainstream, this groundbreaking and provocative book examines how the world's top performers - the Navy SEALS, Googlers, Fortune 100 CEOs - are using altered states to radically accelerate performance and massively improve their lives, and how we can, too. </p> <p>Ultimately, <i>Stealing Fire</i> is a book about profound possibility - about what is actually possible for ourselves and our species when we unlock the full potential of the human mind. </p>";
