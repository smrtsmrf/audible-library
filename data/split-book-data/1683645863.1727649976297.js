window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A program that will change your entire perspective on life</b></p> <p>In 2017, Sounds True launched the first-ever online course with Michael A. Singer, the best-selling author of <i>The Untethered Soul</i> and <i>The Surrender Experiment</i>. This course has been one of our most well-received - and for good reason. The program features eight profound and inspiring all-new sessions drawn from Singer’s 50 years as a spiritual teacher (and a highly successful business entrepreneur).</p> <p>Now available on CD or as a digital download, <i>Living from a Place of Surrender </i>brings you the same perspective-shifting, spiritually liberating teaching sessions for letting go of stress and fear and aligning with the flow of life in the moment.</p> <p>Here’s what the author has to say about the program:</p> <p>\"Dear friends,</p> <p><i>In case you haven’t noticed, you have a mental dialogue going on inside your head that never stops.</i></p> <p>This is the opening sentence of my book, <i>The Untethered Soul</i>. Since its publication in 2007, I’ve been inundated with questions about why that inner voice is always talking, why so much of what it says is negative and stressful, and most importantly, how you free yourself from it.</p> <p>In this course, we will put to rest any questions you have about that inner dialogue. Not just about quieting it down - but about how to steadily remove the root cause of its existence.</p> <p>One of the greatest lessons you will learn here is that trying to achieve happiness by \"getting what you want\" is actually limiting your happiness. You end up struggling with life instead of experiencing it. True happiness comes only when your inner energy is free to flow. That unhampered flow is, indeed, the goal of this course.</p> <p>We will see that the most effective personal growth technique is to use life to remove your inner blockages, not compensate for them.</p> <p>In this course, you’ll learn about your true relationship to the world unfolding around you and to the thoughts and emotions arising within you. But most importantly, you will come into touch with the real \"you\" - the indwelling consciousness that is witnessing it all.</p> <p>The intention of this course is to change your entire perspective of life. Every session will challenge you to go beyond yourself.</p> <p>With great love and respect,</p> <p>Michael A. Singer\"</p>";
