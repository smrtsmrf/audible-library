window.bookSummaryJSON = "Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, whose previous titles, such as the bestselling <i>Real Magic </i>and <i>Your Erroneous Zones</i>, have touched the lives of millions, now teaches listeners how to tap into the power of their higher selves and live each of their days, regardless of what they are doing, with a greater sense of peace and fulfillment. <p>Developing the sacred self, Dr. Dyer explains, brings an understanding of our place in the world and a sense of satisfaction in ourselves and others. In <i>Your Sacred Self</i>, Dr. Dyer offers a program that helps listeners establish a spiritually-oriented, rather than an ego-oriented, approach to life. Step by step, Dr. Dyer shows us how to progress from emotional awareness to psychological insight to spiritual alternatives in order to change our experience of life from the need to acquire to a sense of abundance; from a sense of one's self as sinful and inferior to a sense of one's self as divine; from a need to achieve and acquire to an awareness that detachment and letting go bring freedom.</p> <p><i>Your Sacred Self</i> is an inspiring, hopeful, illuminating guide that can help everyone live a happier, richer, more meaningful life.</p>";
