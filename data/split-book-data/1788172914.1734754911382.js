window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This anniversary edition celebrates 10 years since the publication of David Hamilton's radical title, <i>How Your Mind Can Heal Your Body</i>. A game changer in the field, it proposed we could use the power of imagination and thought processes to stimulate our body's own defences and healing systems to combat disease, pain, and illness. </p> <p>Updated with the latest scientific research on the mind-body connection, the audiobook compiles the scientific studies that have been done in the past 10 years. In addition to the existing real-life stories from people who have successfully visualised themselves well, David has conducted new case studies that confirm the success of his methods. These true stories include recoveries from autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, heart conditions, viruses, eyesight problems, sporting injuries, and even colds and flu. </p> <p>Finally, the audiobook offers listeners an A-to-Z list of visualisations for different physical (and some mental) conditions, based on real examples from David's popular workshops, to enable listeners to implement David's revolutionary methods.</p>";
