window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A world-renowned expert in lucid dreaming and Tibetan dream yoga guides us into the tradition’s </b><b><i>daytime</i></b><b> practices, a complement to the nighttime practices taught in his previous offering </b><b><i>Dream Yoga</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Most of us are absolutely certain that we’re awake here and now - it’s a given, right? Yet, according to Tibet’s dream yoga tradition, ordinary waking life is no more real than the illusions of our nightly dreams. </p> <p>In his previous offering <i>Dream Yoga</i>, Andrew Holecek guided us into Tibetan Buddhism’s nocturnal path of lucid dreaming and other dimensions of sleeping consciousness. Now, with <i>Dreams of Light</i>, he offers us an in-depth, step-by-step guide to its <i>daytime</i> practices. </p> <p>Known as the “illusory form” practices, these teachings include insights, meditations, and actions to help us realize the dreamlike nature of our lives. Through an immersive exploration of the tradition, beginners and seasoned practitioners alike will learn everything they need to deeply transform both their sleeping and waking hours. </p> <p>“If you’ve struggled to awaken in your dreams”, teaches Holecek, “these techniques will often spark spontaneous lucidity during sleep. And if you’re already a successful lucid dreamer, they will open you to new depths of experience throughout your day.” </p> <p>For those wishing to explore Tibetan Buddhism’s profound path for awakening to the true nature of reality - day or night - <i>Dreams of Light</i> shows us the way.</p>";
