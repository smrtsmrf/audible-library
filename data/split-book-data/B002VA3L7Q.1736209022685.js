window.bookSummaryJSON = "Here is an extraordinary new approach to healing by an extraordinary physician-writer - a book filled with the mystery, wonder, and hope of people who have experienced seemingly miraculous recoveries from cancer and other serious illnesses. <p>Dr. Deepak Chopra, a respected New England endocrinologist, began his search for answers when he saw patients in his own practice who completely recovered after being given only a few months to live. In the mid-1980s he returned to his native India to explore Ayurveda, humanities most ancient healing tradition. Now he has combined the current research of Western medicine, neuroscience, and physics with the insights of Ayurvedic theory to show that the human body is controlled by a \"network of intelligence\" grounded in quantum reality.</p> <p> Not a superficial psychological state, this intelligence lies deep enough to change the basic patterns that design our physiology, with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, and even aging. In this inspiring and pioneering work, Dr. Chopra offers us both a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing.</p>";
