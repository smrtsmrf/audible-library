window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.</b></p> <p>Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds.</p> <p>The Bands of Mourning are the mythical metal minds owned by the Lord Ruler, said to grant anyone who wears them the powers that the Lord Ruler had at his command. Hardly anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can read. Waxillium Ladrian is recruited to travel south to the city of New Seran to investigate. Along the way he discovers hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and the shadowy organization known as The Set.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson</p> <p><i>The Cosmere</i></p> <p><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></p> <p><i>The Way of Kings</i></p> <p><i>Words of Radiance</i></p> <p><i>Edgedancer (Novella)</i></p> <p><i>Oathbringer </i></p> <p>The Mistborn trilogy</p> <p><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></p> <p><i>The Well of Ascension</i></p> <p><i>The Hero of Ages</i></p> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series</p> <p><i>Alloy of Law</i></p> <p><i>Shadows of Self</i></p> <p>Bands of Mourning Collection</p> <p><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></p> <p><i>Other Cosmere novels</i></p> <p><i>Elantris</i></p> <p><i>Warbreaker</i></p> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series</p> <p><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></p> <p><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></p> <p><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></p> <p><i>The Shattered Lens</i></p> <p><i>The Dark Talent</i></p> <p>The Rithmatist series</p> <p><i>The Rithmatist</i></p> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson</p> <p><i>The Reckoners</i></p> <p><i>Steelheart</i></p> <p><i>Firefight</i></p> <p><i>Calamity </i></p>";
