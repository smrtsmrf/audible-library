window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A Happy Pocket Full of Money</i>, first published in 2001, so impressed Rhonda Byrne, that she asked author David Cameron Gikandi to be the Creative Consultant on the global film phenomenon, <i>The Secret</i>.</p> <p>True wealth is not about buckets of cash. True wealth is not about designer clothes. It is not about a new Mercedes. It is not about living in a palatial estate. True wealth is about discovering value within yourself and value within other people. It is about a kind of conscious living that incorporates gratitude, a belief in abundance, and the experience of joy. Based on the recent discoveries of theoretical physics and a close reading of inspirational classics of the last century, Gikandi creates a new model for the creation of personal wealth; a new model that shows readers how to create abundance by saving, giving, offering charity, and building happy relationships. </p> <ul> <li>Learn to use an internal mantra to build wealth consciousness.</li> <li>Practice conscious and deliberate thoughts and intentions.</li> <li>Decide, define, and set goals you can believe in.</li> <li>Practice gratitude, giving, and faith, and experience abundance and joy in your life.</li> </ul>";
