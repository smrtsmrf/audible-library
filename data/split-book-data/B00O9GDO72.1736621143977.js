window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover the ancient science of life and awaken your power of healing, success, and miracles.</b> </p> <p>Is it possible that the choices you make in every moment of every day have a direct effect on the world around you? Could it be that our ancient ancestors left precise instructions for us on how to use our choices to bring healing to our bodies and lasting peace to our modern world? </p> <p>In <i>Speaking the Lost Language of God: Awakening the Forgotten Wisdom of Prayer, Prophecy, and the Dead Sea Scrolls</i>, you'll discover that the answer to these and similar questions is a resounding \"Yes!\" Visionary and scientist Gregg Braden takes you on a journey of exploration, discovery, mystery, and insight. A journey that leads you to the wisdom of the ancients and an understanding that the most powerful force in the universe resides within you now. </p> <p>In this illuminating program, Gregg cites study after study in which modern science is now proving what the ancients have been saying since the beginning of time: There is an unseen web of energy that connects us all. A growing number of scientist call this web of energy the Mind of God. </p> <p>It's through this newly recognized form of energy that we are connected to one another and to the events of our lives. Consciously or unconsciously, this web reflects each choice we make as the healing of our bodies and the peace of the world. As we come to understand this \"inner technology\" we can claim the experiences that we choose, not only for ourselves, but for our family and our community as well. </p> <p></p>";
