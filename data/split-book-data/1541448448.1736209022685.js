window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A groundbreaking look at improving desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction through mindfulness. </p> <p>Studies show that approximately half of all women experience some kind of sexual difficulty at one point in their lives, with lack of interest in sex being by far the most common - and the most distressing. And when sex suffers, so do all other areas of life. </p> <p>But it doesn't have to be that way. In <i>Better Sex Through Mindfulness</i>, acclaimed psychologist and sex researcher Lori A. Brotto offers a groundbreaking approach to improving desire, arousal, and satisfaction inside - and outside of - the bedroom. </p> <p>A pioneer in the use of mindfulness for treating sexual difficulties, Brotto has helped hundreds of women cultivate more exciting, fulfilling sexual experiences. In this accessible, relatable audiobook, she explores the various reasons for sexual problems, such as stress and incessant multitasking, and tells the stories of many of the women she has treated over the years. She also provides easy, effective exercises that listeners can do on their own to increase desire and sexual enjoyment, whether their goal is to overcome a sexual difficulty or simply give their love life a boost.</p>";
