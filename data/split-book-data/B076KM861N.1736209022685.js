Also included are the winning fan submissions from the Macmillan Audio When to Jump contest.</b></p> <p><b>An inspirational audiobook that lays out the \"Jump Curve\" - four steps to wholeheartedly pursuing the career of your dreams - through experiences from a variety of people who have jumped and never looked back</b> </p> <p>When Mike Lewis was 24 and working in a prestigious corporate job, he eagerly wanted to leave and pursue his dream of becoming a professional squash player. But he had questions: When is the right time to move from work that is comfortable to a career you have only dared to dream of? How have other people made such a jump? What did they feel when making that jump - and afterward? </p> <p>Mike sought guidance from others who had \"jumped\", and the responses he got - from a banker who started a brewery, a publicist who became a bishop, a garbage collector who became a furniture designer, and on and on - were so clear-eyed and inspiring that Mike wanted to share what he had learned with others who might be helped by those stories. First, though, he started playing squash professionally. </p> <p>The right audiobook at the right time, <i>When to Jump</i> offers more than 40 heartening stories (from the founder of Bonobos, the author of <i>The Big Short</i>, the designer of the Lyft logo, the Humans of New York creator, and many more) and takeaways that will inspire, instruct, and reassure, including the ingenious four-phase Jump Curve. </p> <p>This program is read by Mike Lewis, Sheryl Sandberg, Jeff Arch, Betsy Lewis, Nate Chambers, Laura McKowen, Tommy Clark, Elle Luna, Lawrence Campbell, Fernando Rodriguez-Villa, Merle R.
