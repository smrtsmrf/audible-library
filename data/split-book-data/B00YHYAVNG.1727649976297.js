window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER • From the author of </b><b><i>The Untethered Soul </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Living Untethered</i></b><b> comes the astonishing true-life story about the spiritual harmony and personal happiness he found when he just let go.</b><br> <br> <b>“With his hallmark precision and clarity Michael Singer reveals how everyday life, doing business in the world, and spiritual practice can be synchronized to carry us into the heart of life’s unimaginable perfection.”—Jack Canfield, co-author of </b><b><i>The Success Principles</i></b><b> and co-creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul® series</b><br> <br> In <i>The Surrender Experiment,</i> Michael A. Singer tells the extraordinary story of what happened when, after a deep spiritual awakening, he decided to relinquish his personal fears and desires and simply let life unfold before him. Singer shares how this pivotal decision to embrace the flow of life led him to extraordinary success, sustained him through times of crisis, and allowed him to cultivate profound inner peace—whether as a young man pursuing a life of solitude in the woods, the founder of a thriving spiritual community in Florida, or the CEO of a billion-dollar medical software company.<br> <br> As he takes you through his grand experiment, Singer demonstrates how surrender is the key to a peaceful and harmonious life. His remarkable and unexpected personal experiences will challenge your deepest assumptions, teaching you how to stop making the outside world conform to your desires, let go of the need to control everything, and place your trust in life’s perfection.<br> <br> Thought-provoking and moving, <i>The Surrender Experiment </i>will inspire you to seek the calm and freedom that comes from letting go.</p>";
