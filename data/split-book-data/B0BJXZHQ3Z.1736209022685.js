window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There's no shortage of networking and entrepreneurship advice in books and on social media in today's world-but it's harder than ever to know what's authentic. To make matters worse, taking the wrong advice can result in superficial connections, transactional relationships, and unsatisfying interactions with others without any real rapport. Fortunately, as entrepreneur and marketer extraordinaire Joe Polish has discovered, there's a simple (though sometimes not easy) way out that begins with one question: \"What's in it for them?\"</p> <p>In What's in It for Them?, Polish faces the problem of personal and professional disconnection head-on, offering entrepreneurs a heart- and mind-expanding guide on how to:</p> <ul> <li>Deepen rapport and connect with others by identifying and reducing their suffering</li> <li>Update Dale Carnegie's insights to win the right friends and influence the right people</li> <li>Overcome others' intimidation tactics to find true appreciation in relationships</li> <li>Build character for better results than capabilities can ever give on their own</li> <li>Use basic marketing principles to find true love</li> <li>Protect your efforts from the \"takers\" of the world</li> <li>And much more-all to help the givers of the world thrive in business without neglecting their relationships.</li> </ul> <p>Early in life, Joe Polish's struggles with trauma and addiction led him to a disconnected life. After getting sober in recovery, he spent years developing his genuine and generous approach to building rapport and transformed from a dead broke carpet cleaner to being dubbed \"the most connected person on the planet\" for his work with Genius Network, one of the world's most impactful networking groups for high-achieving entrepreneurs. After 3 years of putting his own advice into practice, Polish now speaks to audiences all around the world and is surrounded by business leaders and billionaires he calls friends.</p> <p>In What's in It for Them?, he explains his one-of-a-kind approach to rapport-building he used to get there-and offers a few cautionary tales along the way.</p> <p>This audio product contains a PDF with supporting material, and the PDF is available to download.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
