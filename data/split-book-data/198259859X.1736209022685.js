window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this courageous, leading-edge book, Jeff Brown takes us on the spiritual ride of a lifetime. In Part One, we join him on an engaging, often hilarious, and compelling personal journey through decades of tasting from a banquet of spiritual approaches. Through his direct experience, fierce exploration, and scintillating discernment, Brown exposes the fragmented, ungrounded, and dissociative notions of spirituality that have imprisoned our consciousness and obstructed our awakening since time immemorial. In his cuttingly straight style, he reveals that much of what we have been calling \"spirituality\" is actually a patriarchal, emotionally bereft construct that perpetuates our self-avoidance. He then proves to us - point by brilliant point - that true spirituality is a whole-being awakening that wonderfully embraces our entire human experience. </p> <p>In Part Two of <i>Grounded Spirituality</i>, Brown engages in a riveting dialogue with an ungrounded seeker named \"Michael.\" Their dialogues unfurl in warmth, humor, playfulness, and personal story, threaded with challenging confrontation and cutting truth. Hands-on exercises are dispersed throughout, providing listeners with a direct experience of a new, inclusive model. Here the author lays down the tracks for a more balanced, heartfelt, and relational spirituality - one that leaves us \"enrealed\", integrated, and purposeful. </p>";
