Goswami's hypothesis is that quantum physics holds the key to all the unsolved mysteries of biology - the nature and origin of life, fossil gaps of evolution, why evolution proceeds from simple to complex, and why biological beings have feeling and consciousness. </p> <p>In <i>God Is Not Dead</i>, Goswami moves beyond theory and shows how a God-based science puts ethics and values where it belongs: at the center of our lives and societies. He provides a scientific model that steers between scientific materialism and religious fundamentalism; a model that has implications for how we live both individually and collectively. </p> <p><i>God Is Not Dead</i> is a fascinating tour of quantum physics, consciousness, and the existence and experience of God. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
