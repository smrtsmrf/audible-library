window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Karol Truman provides a comprehensive and enlightening resource for getting in touch with unresolved feelings which, she explains, can distort not only happiness but also health and well-being. Leaving no emotion unnamed, and in fact listing around 750 labels for feelings, Truman helps identify problem areas, and offers a \"script\" to help process the feelings, replacing the negative feeling with a new, positive outlook. A chapter on the possible emotions below the surface in various physical ailments gives the listener plenty to work with on a deep healing level. <i>Feelings Buried Alive Never Die</i> combines a supportive, common-sense, results-oriented approach to a problem that is widespread and that can stop people from living fully.</p>";
