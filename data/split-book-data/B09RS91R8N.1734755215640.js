window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do multiple versions of ourselves exist in parallel universes living out their lives in different timelines? In this follow-up to his best seller, <i>The Simulation Hypothesis</i>, MIT computer scientist and Silicon Valley game pioneer Rizwan Virk explores these topics from a new lens: that of simulation theory. </p> <p>If we are living in a simulated universe composed of information that is rendered around us, then many of the complexities and baffling characteristics of our reality start to make more sense. In particular, the two most popular interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Copenhagen interpretation and the Many Worlds interpretation, which are thought to be mutually exclusive, can be unified in an information-based framework. </p> <p>Quantum computing lets us simulate complex phenomena in parallel, allowing the simulation to explore many realities at once to find the most \"optimum\" path forward. Could this explain not only the enigmatic Mandela effect, but provide us with a new understanding of time and space?</p> <p>Bringing his unique trademark style of combining video games, computer science, quantum physics, and computing with lots of philosophy and science fiction, Virk gives us a new way to think about not just our universe, but all possible timelines in the multiverse!</p>";
