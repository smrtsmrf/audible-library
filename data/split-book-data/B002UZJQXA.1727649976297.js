window.bookSummaryJSON = "Perhaps no book in this generation has had a more profound impact on our intellectual and spiritual lives than <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>. With sales of more than 7 million copies in the United States and Canada, and translation into more than 23 languages, it has made publishing history, with more than 10 years on <i>The New York Times</i> best seller list. <p>Told in a voice that is timeless in its message of understanding, <i>The Road Less Traveled</i> continues to enable us to explore the nature of loving relationships and leads us toward a new serenity and fullness of life. It helps us determine how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one's own true self.</p> <p>Recognizing that \"Life is difficult\" and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his listeners, but gently guides them through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding.</p> <p>Combining profound psychological insight and deep spirituality, this is an audiobook that provides inspiration and understanding. </p>";
