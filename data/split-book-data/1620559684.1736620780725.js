window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A guide to the practice of Sound Balancing, using tuning forks to clear trauma stored in the human energy field</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Provides a precise map of the energetic biofield that surrounds the body, showing where specific emotions, memories, traumas, and pain are stored </li> <li>Details how to locate stored trauma in the biofield with a tuning fork and clear it </li> <li>2015 Nautilus Silver Award </li> </ul> <p>When Eileen McKusick began offering sound therapy in her massage practice she soon discovered she could use tuning forks to locate and hear disturbances in the energy field, or biofield, that surrounded each of her clients. She found these energetic disturbances correlated with the emotional and physical traumas her clients had experienced throughout their lives, the biofield acting as a record of pain, stress, and trauma from gestation onward. Passing the forks through these areas in the biofield not only corrected the distorted vibrational sounds she was hearing but also imparted consistent, predictable, and sometimes immediate relief from pain, anxiety, insomnia, migraines, depression, fibromyalgia, digestive disorders, and a host of other complaints. Now, nearly 20 years later, McKusick has fully developed her sound healing method, which she calls Sound Balancing, and created a map of the biofield, revealing the precise locations where specific emotions, memories, ailments, and traumas are stored. </p> <p>In this book, McKusick explains the complete practice of Sound Balancing and provides illustrations of her Biofield Anatomy Map. She details how to use tuning forks to find and clear pain and trauma stored in the biofield. She reveals how the traditional principles and locations of the chakras correspond directly with her biofield discoveries. Exploring the science behind Sound Balancing, she examines scientific research on the nature of sound and energy and explains how experiences of trauma produce “pathological oscillations” in the biofield, causing a breakdown of order, structure, and function in the body. </p> <p>Offering a revolutionary perspective on mind, energy, memory, and trauma, McKusick's guide to Sound Balancing provides new avenues of healing for energy workers, massage therapists, sound healers, and those looking to overcome chronic illness and release the traumas of their past.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
