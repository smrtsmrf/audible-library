window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This audiobook contains updated material from the original edition.<br> <br> Discover how to become the best version of you and develop healthy habits, find inspiring new perspectives and live a motivated, joy-filled life!</b><br> <b><br> </b>Who is your Future Self? That question is the answer to all your life's questions. When you know who you want to be then you know what you're going to do today. That answer directly impacts how motivated you are, and how you feel about yourself. It's the answer to whether you'll distract yourself on social media for hours, whether you'll eat junk food and what time you get up in the morning.<br> <br> It's not only useful to see your Future Self as a different person from who you are today, but it is also essential. Your Future Self will not be the same person you are today. They will see the world differently. They'll have had experiences, challenges and growth you currently don't have. They'll have different goals and priorities. They'll have different habits. They'll also be in a different world - a world with different cultural values, different technologies and different challenges.<br> <br> Renowned psychologist Dr Benjamin Hardy will show you how to allow your imagined Future Self to be the driver of your current reality so that you can change in unbelievable ways.<br> <br> <b>This audio product contains a PDF with supporting material, and the PDF is available to download.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
