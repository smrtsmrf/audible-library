With few exceptions, those beliefs come from what science, history, religion, and other people tell us. </p> <p>What if those beliefs are wrong? </p> <p>Historically, we have been taught that we are passive observers in the universe and that we are governed by the \"rules\" of time, space, and our DNA. It is precisely these beliefs that often leave us feeling powerless in the face of life's greatest challenges. </p> <p>What if we are limited only until we change the way we see ourselves in the world? How differently would we live if we discovered that we are born with the power to choose the reality of our world, how healthy we are, and even how long we live? </p> <p>Such a radical discovery would change everything about the way we see ourselves! It is also precisely what the leading-edge science of today is showing us. </p> <p>In <i>The Spontaneous Healing of Belief</i>, you will discover paradigm-shattering revelations that demonstrate why: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>We are not limited by the laws of physics as we know them today! </li> <li>We are not limited by the laws of biology as we know them today! </li> <li>Our DNA is a code that we can change and \"upgrade\" by choice! </li> </ul> <p></p>";
