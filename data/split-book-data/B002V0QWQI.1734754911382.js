window.bookSummaryJSON = "In <i>The Mastery of Love</i>, don Miguel Ruiz illuminates the fear-based beliefs and assumptions that undermine love and lead to suffering and drama in our relationships. Using insightful stories to bring his message to life, Ruiz shows us how to heal our emotional wounds, recover the freedom and joy that are our birthright, and restore the spirit of playfulness that is vital to loving relationships. <p>In the Toltec tradition, three fundamental masteries guide us to our true nature, which is happiness, freedom, and love.</p> <p>The first is the Mastery of Awareness. This mastery teaches us to be aware of what we really are. It is the first step toward freedom because we cannot be free if we don't know what we are, or what kind of freedom we are looking for. The Toltecs said, \"Let us see ourselves with truth\", and they created a mastery just for awareness.</p> <p>The second is the Mastery of Transformation, which teaches us how to become spiritual warriors and stalk our actions and reactions so we can break free of the knowledge that enslaves us. This mastery shows us how to change the dream of our life by changing our agreements and beliefs.</p> <p>The Mastery of Love is the result of the first two masteries. From the Toltec perspective, everything is made of Love. Love is Life itself. When we master Love, we align with the Spirit of Life passing through us. We are no longer the body, or the mind, or the soul; we are Love. Then every action we take is an expression of Love, and Love in action can only produce happiness.</p> <p>When we master Awareness, Transformation, and Love, we reclaim our divinity and become one with God. This is the goal of the Toltec.</p>";
