window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Boundaries are the ways we communicate our needs. They are what allow us to feel safe among strangers, in everyday interactions, and in our closest relationships. When we have healthy boundaries, we have a strong foundation in an uncertain world. And when someone crosses your boundaries, or you cross someone else’s, the result range from unsettling to catastrophic.</p> <p>In this audiobook, best-selling author Dr. Faith Harper offers a full understanding of issues of boundaries and consent, how we can communicate and listen more effectively, and how to survive and move on from situations where our boundaries are violated. </p> <p>Along the way, you’ll learn when and how to effectively say “no” (and “yes”), troubleshoot conflict, and respect your own and others’ boundaries like a pro. You’ll be amazed at how much these skills improve your relationships with friends, strangers, coworkers, and loved ones. </p>";
