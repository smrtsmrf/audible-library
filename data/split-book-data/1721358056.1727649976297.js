window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>How Emotions Are Made,</i></b><b> a myth-busting primer on the brain in the tradition of </b><b><i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.</i></b></p> <p>Have you ever wondered why you have a brain? Let renowned neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett demystify that big gray blob between your ears. In seven short essays (plus a bite-sized story about how brains evolved), this slim, entertaining, and accessible collection reveals mind-expanding lessons from the front lines of neuroscience research. You'll learn where brains came from, how they're structured (and why it matters), and how yours works in tandem with other brains to create everything you experience. Along the way, you'll also learn to dismiss popular myths such as the idea of a \"lizard brain\" and the alleged battle between thoughts and emotions, or even between nature and nurture, to determine your behavior.</p> <p>Sure to intrigue casual listeners and scientific veterans alike, <i>Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain</i> is full of surprises, humor, and important implications for human nature - a gift of a book that you will want to savor again and again.</p>";
