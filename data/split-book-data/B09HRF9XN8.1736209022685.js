window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of </b><b><i>Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man</i></b><b>, a call to break through our limits and say yes to a life of infinite possibility.</b></p> <p>You may know Emmanuel Acho as the host of groundbreaking video series “Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man”. Or as a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author. Or as an Emmy-winning television broadcaster. Or as a former linebacker for two NFL franchises. </p> <p>What you probably don’t know is that Emmanuel defines his own life with just one word: <i>illogical</i>. </p> <p>Behind every triumph, every expression of his gifts, Acho has had to ignore what everyone around him called “logic”: the astronomical odds against making it, the risks of continuing to dream bigger or differently. Instead of playing it safe, at every turn Acho has thrown conventional wisdom—logic—out the window. Now, in this revelatory book, he’s empowering us all to do the same.</p> <p>Whether it’s creating the next groundbreaking start-up, fighting for change as an activist, or committing to a personal passion, <i>Illogical</i> is the go-to audiobook for all listeners ready to become change-makers. With a step-by-step guide to finding our callings and shifting our mindsets, enlivened by stories from Acho’s life and other illogical pioneers, Acho asks us to replace the limits set for us, and those we set for ourselves, with a world of possibility. Our horizons, he shows us, are endless.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books</b></p>";
