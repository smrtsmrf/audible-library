window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What makes sex magnificent? What are the qualities of extraordinary erotic intimacy, and what are the elements that help to bring it about? Is great sex the stuff that people remember nostalgically from the \"honeymoon\" phase of their relationships, or can sex improve over time?</p> <p><i>Magnificent Sex </i>is based on the largest, in-depth interview study ever conducted with people who are having extraordinary sex. It gathers the nuggets for remarkable sex from the \"experts\", distilling them into an attainable blueprint for ordinary lovers who want to make erotic intimacy grow over the course of a lifetime. Looking at factors including individual and relational qualities, empathic communication, and the myths and realities of magnificent sex, this book offers accessible and evidence-based guidance for lovers and therapists alike. It is replete with frank and often humorous interviews with straight and LGBTQ individuals and couples, those who are \"vanilla\" and \"kinky\", monogamous and consensually non-monogamous and healthy and chronically ill. This illuminating book explores the implications of the findings to develop a model that effectively tackles the common problems of low desire and frequency. The \"cure\" for low desire is to create desirable sex! </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
