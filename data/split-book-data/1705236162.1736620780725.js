Writing in a style that is both lucid and charming, mischievous and profound, Dr. Amit Goswami uses the language and concepts of quantum physics to explore and scientifically prove metaphysical theories of reincarnation and immortality.</p> <p>In <i>Physics of the Soul</i>, Goswami helps listeners understand the perplexities of the quantum physics model of reality and the perennial beliefs of spiritual and religious traditions. He shows how they are not only compatible but also provide essential support for each other. The result is a deeply broadened, exciting, and enriched worldview that integrates mind and spirit into science.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
