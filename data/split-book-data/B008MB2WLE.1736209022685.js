window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book four in the blockbuster Maze Runner series that spawned a movie franchise and ushered in a worldwide phenomenon! And don’t miss <i>The Fever Code</i>, the highly anticipated series conclusion that finally reveals the story of how the maze was built!</p> <p>Before WICKED was formed, before the Glade was built, before Thomas entered the Maze, sun flares hit the earth, killing most of the population. </p> <p>Mark and Trina were there when it happened. They survived. But now a virus is spreading. A virus that fills humans with murderous rage. </p> <p>They’re convinced that there’s a way to save those who are left - if they can stay alive. Because in this new, devastated world, every life has a price. And to some you’re worth more dead than alive. </p> <p>The end is only the beginning. </p> <p><i>The Maze Runner</i>, <i>Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials</i>, and <i>Maze Runner: The Death Cure</i> are all now major motion pictures featuring the star of MTV's <i>Teen Wolf</i>, Dylan O’Brien; Kaya Scodelario; Aml Ameen; Will Poulter; and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Also look for James Dashner’s edge-of-your-seat Mortality Doctrine series! </p> <p>“James Dashner’s illuminating prequel [<i>The Kill Order</i>] will thrill fans of this Maze Runner [series] and prove just as exciting for readers new to the series.” (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>, starred)</p>";
