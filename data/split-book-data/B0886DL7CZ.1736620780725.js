window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Howard Lester, a young scientist, becomes obsessed with the problem of death and begins a series of unconventional experiments aimed at increasing human longevity. In the course of their research, Lester and his friend Sir Henry Littleway make a startling discovery: A simple, harmless operation on the brain's prefrontal cortex results in vastly expanded consciousness and mental powers.</p> <p>After undergoing the procedure themselves, Lester and Littleway develop remarkable abilities, including \"time vision\", a means of seeing backwards into time. They begin by looking at the relatively recent past - the 18th century and Shakespeare's England. But they soon find they can see much further back, to the days of Stonehenge and the Mayans, and even earlier.</p> <p>But as they get closer to uncovering the beginnings of human existence, they make a terrifying discovery. Something ancient and immensely powerful, long asleep, has been awakened by their activities, and it is determined to stop them at all costs.</p> <p>In <i>The Strength to Dream</i> (1962), Colin Wilson had criticized the works of H.P. Lovecraft, the American writer of weird tales, which led to Lovecraft's publisher August Derleth daring Wilson to write one better. This novel <i>The Philosopher's Stone</i> (1969) was the result of a fascinating blend of science fiction, horror, and philosophy, told within the framework of Lovecraft's mythos.</p> <p><b>Praise for the book:</b></p> <p>\"An important literary achievement.\" (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p> <p>\"Colin Wilson has a narrative style that can make the pursuit of any idea seem like exciting detective work.\" (<i>The Times</i>)</p> <p>\"Colin Wilson's best novel to date.\" (<i>The Spectator</i>)</p>";
