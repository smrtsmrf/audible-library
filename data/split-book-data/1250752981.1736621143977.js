This audiobook also includes a foreword written and read by Graham Hancock, the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>America Before: The Key to Earth's Lost Civilization.</i></b></p> <p><b>THE </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER</b></p> <p><b>As seen on The Joe Rogan Experience! From the host of Netflix’s </b><b><i>Ancient Apocalypse</i></b></p> <p><b>This program includes a Foreword written and read by Graham Hancock, the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>America Before: The Key to Earth's Lost Civilization</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>A groundbreaking dive into the role psychedelics have played in the origins of Western civilization, and a real-life quest for the Holy Grail.</p> <p>The most influential religious historian of the 20th century, Huston Smith, once referred to it as the \"best-kept secret\" in history. Did the Ancient Greeks use drugs to find God? And did the earliest Christians inherit the same, secret tradition? A profound knowledge of visionary plants, herbs and fungi passed from one generation to the next, ever since the Stone Age?</p> <p>With an unquenchable thirst for evidence, Muraresku takes the listener on his twelve-year global hunt for proof. He tours the ruins of Greece with its government archaeologists. He gains access to the hidden collections of the Louvre Museum to show the continuity from pagan to Christian wine. He unravels the Ancient Greek of the New Testament with a Catholic priest. He spelunks into the catacombs under the streets of Rome to decipher the lost symbols of Christianity’s oldest monuments. He breaches the secret archives of the Vatican to unearth manuscripts never before translated into English. And with leads from the archaeological chemists at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he unveils the first scientific data for the ritual use of psychedelic drugs in classical antiquity.</p> <p><i>The Immortality Key</i> reconstructs the suppressed history of women consecrating a forbidden, drugged Eucharist that was later banned by the Church Fathers. Women who were then targeted as witches during the Inquisition, when Europe’s sacred pharmacology largely disappeared. Have the scientists of today resurrected this lost technology? Is Christianity capable of returning to its roots? </p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b></p>";
