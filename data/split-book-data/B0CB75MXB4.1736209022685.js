Reconnecting to one's ancestors and truly feeling, not only hearing, their stories are fertile ground for true ecstatic embodiment of the self. We have to know where we've been to see where we're going.\" -Willow Smith</b></p> <p><b>\"[Smith] is candid and honest... For the first time she reveals the truth behind [the] happy images. An incredible read.\" -Hoda Kotb, </b><b><i>The Today Show</i></b></p> <p><b>A gripping, at times painfully honest, and ultimately inspirational memoir from global superstar and creator of the </b><b><i>Red Table Talk</i></b><b> series Jada Pinkett Smith.</b></p> <p>Jada Pinkett Smith was living what many would view as a fairy-tale of Hollywood success. But appearances can be deceiving, and as she felt more and more separated from her sense of self, emotional turmoil took hold. Sparing no detail, <i>Worthy</i> chronicles her life—from a rebellious youth running the Baltimore streets as an observer and participant in the drug trade, to the deep bond she shared with Tupac Shakur from the moment they met, to her move to Los Angeles and the successful career she built on her own terms, to becoming the wife of superstar Will Smith and mother to Jaden, Willow and bonus-mom to Trey. A rollercoaster from the depths of suicidal depression to the heights of self-acceptance and spiritual healing, <i>Worthy</i> is a woman’s journey to finding herself again.</p> <p>In a media driven landscape that crafts narratives for our celebrities, Smith shares herself in an intimate conversation with listeners. She answers questions about her difficult childhood, her marriage, her parenting style, her career choices, and the intense scrutiny that followed “the slap.” An impactful and rare memoir that engages and educates, <i>Worthy</i> shows why adhering to the status quo has never been the plan for Jada Pinkett Smith and why labels and stories crafted by others strip women of their authenticity. <i>Worthy</i> teaches us who Jada is, and how to embrace our most lovable qualities. Complete with thought-provoking writing prompts and meditations on how to discover who we really are and nourish our self-worth.</p>";
