window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The honeymoon effect: a state of bliss, passion, energy, and health resulting from a huge love. </p> <p>Your life is so beautiful that you can't wait to get up to start a new day, and you thank the Universe that you are alive. Think back on the most spectacular love affair of your life - the Big One that toppled you head over heels. For most it was a time of heartfelt bliss, robust health, and abundant energy - a firsthand experience of heaven on Earth. </p> <p>Imagine what it would be like if you could maintain the honeymoon effect throughout your whole life. </p> <p>Dr. Bruce H. Lipton describes how the honeymoon effect was not a chance event or a coincidence but a personal creation. Here, Dr. Lipton reveals how we manifest the honeymoon effect and the reasons why we lose it. This knowledge empowers listeners to create the honeymoon experience again, this time in a way that ensures a happily ever after relationship that even a Hollywood producer would love. </p> <p>With authority, eloquence, and an accessible style, Lipton covers the influence of quantum physics (good vibrations), biochemistry (love potions), and psychology (the conscious and subconscious minds) in creating and sustaining loving relationships. He also asserts that we can learn from the example of the harmonious relationships of our 50 trillion cells to create a \"super organism\" called \"humanity\", which can heal our planet. </p>";
