window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Harness the source of your living energy: the Zero Point Field.</b> </p> <p>The cutting edge of quantum physics is not just found in a laboratory or university - now, you can live each day on the frontiers of science. Lynne McTaggart's revolutionary book <i>The Field</i> captivated readers around the world with its exploration of the unseen dimension where science meets spirit. But that was only the beginning. With <i>Living The Field,</i> this pioneering investigator presents a full-length audio workshop about using the scientific discoveries of the quantum age to supercharge your life, health, and consciousness. </p> <p><b>Consciousness is the signal - you are the receiver.</b> </p> <p>How can invisible quantum forces affect the way you live? In light of McTaggart's research, the answer might astonish you: The very essence of your thoughts, memories, and sentient mind arises from the Zero Point Field. Your consciousness is not stored in your brain - instead, your brain is a receiver that picks up the signal of your consciousness from The Field. And through The Field, encoded in its infinite energetic frequencies, you are fundamentally connected to all other life. If you have ever picked up the feelings of a loved one from far away, known what your pet was thinking, worked in synchronicity with a team, or had a strong premonition of the future - then you have already glimpsed the power of this quantum connection. </p> <p>To live The Field is to continuously enhance your ability to receive the signal of this unified consciousness. Distilling the best techniques from her acclaimed workshops, Lynne McTaggart gives you straightforward, practical tools to expand your access to the limitless energy and wisdom of The Field. Whether you wish to boost your health, increase your intuitive powers, turn intention into reality, or even unlock your dormant extrasensory gifts, Lynne McTaggart will help you discover how to achieve profound and life-altering results when you begin <i>Living The Field.</i></p>";
