window.bookSummaryJSON = "The Element is the point at which natural talent meets personal passion. When people arrive at the Element, they feel most themselves, most inspired, and achieve at their highest levels. <p><i>The Element</i> draws on the stories of a wide range of people: Paul McCartney; <i>The Simpsons</i> creator Matt Groening; Meg Ryan; Gillian Lynne, who choreographed the Broadway productions of <i>Cats</i> and <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>; journalist Arianna Huffington; renowned physicist Richard Feynman; and many others, including business leaders and athletes. It explores the components of this new paradigm: the diversity of intelligence, the power of imagination and creativity, and the importance of commitment to our own capabilities.</p> <p>With a wry sense of humor, Ken Robinson looks at the conditions that enable us to find ourselves in the Element and those that stifle that possibility. He shows that age and occupation are no barrier and that once we have found our path, we can help others do so as well. <i>The Element</i> shows the vital need to enhance creativity and innovation by thinking differently about human resources and imagination. It is an essential strategy for transforming education, business, and communities to meet the challenges of living and succeeding in the 21st century.</p>";
