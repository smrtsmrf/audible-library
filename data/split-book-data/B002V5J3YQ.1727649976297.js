window.bookSummaryJSON = "For years, Brian Weiss, M.D., has focused on leading his patients into the past, yet some of them experienced spontaneous pre-cognitive moments. When developing regression into past lives, one man went forward into the future rather than backward. He entered into an idyllic future life - a passage that helped him emotionally. At that moment, Dr. Weiss recognized that past, present, and future are one. What happens in the future can affect the present, just as the past also influences it. <p> <i>Same Soul, Many Bodies</i> illustrates the life-affirming values of empathy, compassion, non-violence, patience, and spirituality, and will prove as utterly fascinating as it is instructive.</p>";
