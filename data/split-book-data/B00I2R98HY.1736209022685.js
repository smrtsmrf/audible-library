window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Scientifically grounded practices for healing and transformation. </p> <p> Modern neuroscience shows that what we do and think can change the physical structure of the brain - yet often this occurs unconsciously, when we habitually react to stress in unhealthy ways. Lisa Wimberger created Neurosculpting® as a complete approach for consciously reshaping our brains for greater happiness, health, creativity, and compassion. With <i>Neurosculpting</i>, she offers you in-depth training in this powerful process for using meditation, mindfulness, diet, and unique daily practices to help you create positive, lasting changes in your brain - and your life. </p> <p>Rewiring your brain for resilience and happiness. </p> <p>The first step in <i>Neurosculpting</i> is to change the way you deal with stress. You'll learn why the brain instinctively responds to everyday stress as a physical threat - and how you can \"rewrite the script\" that your nervous system follows when stressful situations arise. From there, Lisa offers guided meditations and practical strategies to help you improve your physical and emotional health, discover calm and joy, clear self-limiting beliefs, increase your creative flexibility, and connect to others. Through her groundbreaking work with first-responders, Lisa Wimberger has discovered which practices have the greatest success for creating positive change at the neurological level. Rich with scientific research and proven techniques, <i>Neurosculpting</i> is a complete course for becoming an active agent in your own healing and transformation. </p>";
