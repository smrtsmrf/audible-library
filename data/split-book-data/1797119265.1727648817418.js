window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A revised and updated edition of Emily Nagoski’s game-changing </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller </b><b><i>Come As You Are</i></b><b>, featuring new information and research on mindfulness, desire, and pleasure that will radically transform your sex life.</b></p> <p>For much of the 20th and 21st centuries, women’s sexuality was an uncharted territory in science, studied far less frequently - and far less seriously - than its male counterpart. </p> <p>That is, until Emily Nagoski’s <i>Come As You Are</i>, which used groundbreaking science and research to prove that the most important factor in creating and sustaining a sex life filled with confidence and joy is not what the parts are or how they’re organized but how you feel about them. In the years since the book’s initial publication, countless women have learned through Nagoski’s accessible and informative guide that things like stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman’s sexual well-being; they are central to it - and that even if you don’t always feel like it, you are already sexually whole by just being yourself. This revised and updated edition continues that mission with new information and advanced research, demystifying and decoding the science of sex so that everyone can create a better sex life and discover more pleasure than you ever thought possible. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
