window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Heralded by the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Time</i></b><b> as the couples therapy with the highest rate of success, Emotionally Focused Therapy works because it views the love relationship as an attachment bond. </b></p> <p>This idea, once controversial, is now supported by science, and has become widely popular among therapists around the world. In <i>Hold Me Tight</i>, Dr. Sue Johnson presents Emotionally Focused Therapy to the general public for the first time. Johnson teaches that the way to save and enrich a relationship is to reestablish safe emotional connection and preserve the attachment bond. With this in mind, she focuses on key moments in a relationship - from \"Recognizing the Demon Dialogue\" to \"Revisiting a Rocky Moment\" - and uses them as touch points for seven healing conversations.</p> <p>Through case studies from her practice, illuminating advice, and practical exercises, couples will learn how to nurture their relationships and ensure a lifetime of love.</p>";
