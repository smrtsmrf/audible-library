window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exploring the nature of how our experience of what we call “self” emerges across the lifespan.</b></p> <p>Both a personal and general meditation on identity and belonging, Daniel J. Siegel’s book combines personal reflections with scientific discussions of how the mind, brain, and our relationships shape who we are. Weaving the internal and external, the subjective and objective, <b>IntraConnected</b> reveals how our culture may give us a message of separation as a solo, isolated self, but a wider perspective unveils that who we are may be something more―broader than the brain, bigger even than the body―and fundamental to social systems and the natural world.</p> <p>Our body-based self―the origin of a Me―is not only connected to others but connected within our relational worlds themselves―a WE―forming the essence of how we belong and our identity. If the pandemic has taught us nothing else, it has taught us that we are all connected. <b>IntraConnected</b> discusses that bond, as well as other realities of our intraconnected lives.</p>";
