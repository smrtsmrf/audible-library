window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this audiobook,<i> New York Times </i>best-selling author and 2018 Templeton Award nominee Gregg Braden crosses the traditional boundaries of science and spirituality to answer the timeless question at the core of our existence - Who are we? - and to reveal science-based techniques that awaken our uniquely human experiences of deep intuition, precognition, advanced states of self-healing, and much more!</p> <p>In one of the great ironies of the modern world, the science that was expected to solve life’s mysteries has done just the opposite. New discoveries have led to more unanswered questions, created deeper mysteries, and brought us to the brink of forbidden territory when it comes to explaining our origin and existence. <i>The Science of Self-Empowerment </i>invites us on a journey beyond Darwin’s theory of evolution to explore these discoveries and the facts they reveal:</p> <p>Fact 1. Our origin - Modern humans appeared suddenly on earth approximately 200,000 years ago, with the advanced brain, nervous system, and capabilities that set them apart from all other known forms of life already developed, rather than having developed slowly and gradually over a long period of time.</p> <p>Fact 2. Missing physical evidence - The relationships shown on the conventional tree of human evolution are speculative connections only. While they are believed to exist, a 150-year search has failed to produce the physical evidence that confirms the relationships shown on the evolutionary family tree.</p> <p>Fact 3. New DNA evidence - The comparison of DNA between ancient Neanderthals, previously thought to be our ancestors, and early humans tells us that we did not descend from the Neanderthals.</p> <p>Fact 4. A rare DNA fusion - Advanced genome analysis reveals that the DNA that sets us apart from other primates, including in our advanced brain and nervous system, is the result of an ancient and precise fusion of genes occurring in a way that suggests something beyond evolution made our humanness possible.</p> <p>Fact 5. Our extraordinary abilities - We are born with the capacity to self-heal, to self-regulate longevity, to activate an enhanced immune response, and to experience deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, and, ultimately, compassion - and to do each of these on demand.</p> <p>Beyond any reasonable doubt, <i>The Science of Self-Empowerment</i> reveals that we’re not what we’ve been told, and much more than we’ve ever imagined.</p> <p>Note: This audiobook is based on <i>The Science of Self-Empowerment </i>by Gregg Braden, a book previously published as <i>Human by Design</i>.​</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
